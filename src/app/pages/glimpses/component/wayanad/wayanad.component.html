                              Wayanad is a district located in the north-east region of the Indian state of Kerala, at the southernmost tip of the Deccan Plateau.It is known for its cool highland climate, misty peaks and its virgin forests. Wayanad also played a prominent role in the history of the subcontinent. It is often called the spice garden of the south, the land of paddy fields, and the home of the monsoons.
                              “The local legend speaks of Karinthandan, a tribesman of the Panniya clan who revealed the secret route to Wayanad to the world.”
                              Wayanad’s rich history stretches back to the Neolithic Age, with the Edakkal Caves being one of the oldest signs of human settlement to be discovered. The caves seem to have been inhabited by several human settlersover the course of time. Even though very little is known about these ancient settlers, the cave paintings at Edakkal, the burial sites discovered around the caves, and the ancient earthenware found within are proof of their existence.
                              <br>
                              The region is home to some of the oldest temples in India and also played a pivotal role in the worldwide spice trade. In fact it was the legendary spice gardens of Wayanad that prompted the European powers to establish direct sea routes to India. Many a war has been fought for the dominion of this lucrative trade. Even now the best pepper in the world comes from Wayanad’s green slopes.
Wayanad was one of the first regions to actively rise up in defiance against the East India Company. Kerala VarmaPazhassi Raja, called the Lion of Kerala, was one of the earliest freedom fighters of India. He rallied the local lords and tribes against the British, and engaged them in a guerilla war in the forests of Wayanad. Even though he was ultimately killed by the British in 1805, he is still revered for his bravery and ingenuity in battle.

          <legend>Onam</legend><br>
          <p>Onam, a celebration of equality, justice and prosperity, is the State festival which unites all Keralites irrespective of caste, colour or creed and is celebrated in Kerala with pomp and grandeur. The whole state joins in the fervour to celebrate the return of the King Mahabali to meet his ‘prajas’ (subjects). Legend has it that every year, King Mahabali, the righteous king visits the land from the nether world and Keralites unite in festivities to welcome the return of the mythical King Mahabali.
              The whole of Kerala is splashed with vibrance during this season. The ten days of Onam commences on Atham day and goes up to the Thiruvonam day in the Malayalam month of Chingam (August / September). Thiruvonam is the most important day of Onam which is also the harvest festival.
              Starting from Atham, the front yards of houses, offices and other public places are decked in floral arrangements called Athapookkalam to welcome in their king. Every nook and cranny of the state brims with games and the display of traditional art forms.

              <legend>Neelamperoor Padayani</legend><br>
              <p>A highly vibrant festival held at the Neelamperoor Palli Bhagavathy Temple, the Neelamperoor Padayani is a celebration of many colours and cultures. This annual Patayani festival falls in the Malayalam month of Chingam (usually August/September).

                  Patayani, which literally translates to rows of army, is performed at several temples in Kerala. However, the Patayani conducted at Neelamperoor is distinct in many ways. 
                  
                  One of the striking elements and what sets this festival apart is the Kettukazhcha, which involves the display of beautifully decorated effigies. Huge and imposing effigies of swans and other legendary characters are taken out in a grand procession.

              <legend>Pulikali</legend><br>
              <p>Come Onam and the Swaraj Round in Thrissur district becomes a hunting ground teeming
                 with prowling tigers and wily hunters. Each tiger has its ferocity writ large on their faces
                  as well as on their bellies. Yes, bellies, for these are not the four-legged tigers you would
                   come across in the wild. Rather, they are all men with their bodies painted as that of tigers
                    with life like vividness. Pulikali (the play of the tigers) is an event that has become 
                    synonymous with the festival of Onam in Kerala.

              <legend>The Kottiyoor Vysakha Mahotsavam</legend><br>
              <p>The Kottiyoor Vysakha Mahotsavam is a truly mesmerising festival held amidst dense forest with the lush greenery and the gorgeous River Baveli forming a stunning backdrop. This twenty-eight day long festival in Kannur is conducted by two temples, Akkara Kottiyoor and Ikkara Kottiyoor situated on the banks of the River Baveli. 

                  The Akkara Kottiyoor Temple serves as the venue for the festival and is opened only during the festival days. The deity here is believed to be a swayambhoo lingam (self-created idol of Lord Shiva) and the temple is noted for its absence of a formal structure. Here the deity is placed on a raised platform made of river stones named manithara.
